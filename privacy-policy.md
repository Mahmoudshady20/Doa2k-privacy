# Doa2k App Privacy Policy
Effective date: July 1, 2024

Welcome to Doa2k App, The mobile application is designed to help you manage your medication appointments and alert you about them. This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your information and your rights with respect to that information.

## 1. Information Collection
### Personal Data
We do not collect any personal information.

### Medication data
We collect information about your medications, including their name, labels, how often the medication will be taken, the number of days, date, and time.

### Device Information
We may collect information about the device you use to access the Doa2k App, such as the device type, operating system, and unique device identifiers.

## 2. Permissions We Use
### RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED
- Purpose: This permission allows our app to automatically restart scheduled notifications after your device reboots, ensuring you don't miss important reminders even if your device restarts.
- Usage: We use this permission strictly to restart alarms and notifications that were set before the reboot. No personal data is collected or stored as a result of this permission.

### SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM
- Purpose:  The "دوائك" (doa2k) app uses the USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT permission to ensure critical notifications are delivered to you in a full-screen format when necessary. This is particularly important for urgent reminders, such as medication alerts, that need your immediate attention.
- Usage: We use this permission to set exact alarms for notifications. The information related to these alarms is stored locally on your device and is not shared or transmitted.

### USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT
- Purpose: This permission allows our app to display full-screen notifications, ensuring you see critical alerts without delay.
- Justification: The full-screen intent allows us to show notifications that can appear in full screen, even when the device is locked or another application is being used. This ensures you never miss important notifications related to your medication schedule, which is essential for managing your health effectively.

### WAKE_LOCK
- Purpose: This permission allows our app to keep the device awake to ensure that important notifications are delivered and displayed promptly.
- Usage: We use this permission to maintain the device's wake state for brief periods to deliver notifications. It helps ensure timely alerts without collecting any personal information.

## 3. Use of data
The information we collect is used in various ways, including:
- To provide, maintain, and improve the basic features of the Doa2k application, such as tracking and sending you notifications to alert you of your medication appointment
- To send updates, reminders or other important communications related to the Doa2k App

## 4. Data security and retention
We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the Doa2k App Services and comply with our legal obligations.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices
You have the right to access, update, and delete your personal information. You can also choose to opt-out of certain features, such as push notifications.

## 6. Third-Party Services
The Doa2k App may integrate with or contain links to third-party services, such as social media platforms. These third-party services have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these services.
